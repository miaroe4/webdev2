Slack Technologies. It is meant to help people and their teams work together more seamlessly. It was
designed this way in order to help support the way people naturally work together, so that they can
collaborate with other people online as efficiently as you do face-to-face. The main part of slack is called
the workspace, which is made of different channels, each belonging to a different team member where

channels for conversation between just you and an individual member, you can even start a voice or
video call with any other members.

      <h2>  Cautions and Warnings </h2>
  <p>           When approaching to use any social media app there can be issues, challenges and safety problems that we have to face. What's most important is that you're using the app responsibly and safely. Slack's Missions statement is ‘Making work simpler, more pleasant, and more productive.’ which they try to promote very much. </p> 

  <h2>      Challenges Of Using SLACK:  </h2>
   <p>           When using Slack there isn’t many challenges that have been documented or that we can find there really is only a few: </p> 

  <p>               It can become quite messy and discatered and you can start to lose track of  things as multiple different conversations .
 The layout of the channel conversations can cause difficulty as one conversation after another it can be hard sustaining a full conversation. </p> 


    <h2>    Advice On Safety Precautions:</h2>

 <p>        With using any app you have to be careful on what you should share. </p> 

 <p>        Advice that I would give is to not  share too much information, Slack can be used as an app for business and revealing too much about yourself or your life can seem somewhat unprofessional.
In ties with the point above, be careful on how you text or say as everyone can view this information.</p> 

     <h2>   Age Limits</h2>
            <p> To use the app Slack you must be older than 16 years old.</p> 

   <h2>     How it can be misused: </h2>

    <p>         Slack provides a service for all users called ‘Channels’, channels allows you to communicate to a person or a group through a hashtag set up by an admin when you join the hashtag you're a part of the group channel. E.G. #businessclub
In regards to these ‘channels’ they can sometimes become more of a immature group chat than a professional outlet where groups of people can share their files, emails or notes.</p> 


  <h2>     Trolling/bullying:   </h2>

  <p>           Linking in with the use of ‘channels’ bullying can happen as when joining groups with people who have the same interests but different outlooks can cause conflicts. There is not a lot of bullying documented on the app which is a positive.

As slack was created for people to work together to communicate it unfortunately does not allow you to block, mute or report people. This reason being the app wants you to work together to solve the issue as if you were on a team. </p> 


     <h2>   Security:</h2>

            <p> Tips that can help when dealing with privacy from this app:
When ever using any social media app never share any personal details like passwords, financial information.
When ever using the app to communicate, remember that people can see directly who is talking so don’t say something you will later regret.</p>
